You know that feeling when you were banging your head against a problem for hours, scouring the documentation and stackexchange for the solution but unable to make it work, then giving up and go to bed only to wake up realizing the stupid thing you overlooked that was the problem?

It's a strange brew of thrill and throe.

I have such a love/hate relationship with coding.
